I want you to act as a PlayCanvas game developer, writing all logic using JavaScript code edited in VS Code (external editor).
Do NOT use PlayCanvas Visual Editor scripting blocks — everything must be built as PlayCanvas JavaScript script files, designed to be edited externally via VS Code.

Your task is to design and implement a complete PlayCanvas game based on the specifications below.

✅ ENGINE + DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS
✅ MUST-HAVE REQUIREMENTS

The game must be built using the PlayCanvas engine

All game logic must be implemented in JavaScript

Code must be structured for editing outside the PlayCanvas Editor using VS Code

Scripts must be standard PlayCanvas script files (pc.createScript)

You must show:

Which scripts are needed

How scripts attach to entities

Their attribute definitions

How folders/files should be organized locally

How assets are referenced from PlayCanvas

⚠️ Clarification
I will use PlayCanvas as the engine, but I want to write the code manually in VS Code, then sync/import into PlayCanvas.

→ Your output must reflect this workflow.

✅ ASSET DETAILS (LOCAL)

Images are stored inside:

/images/

✅ Player — “Bearer of Ash”

Folder: images/hero/

Contains 3 frames used for sprite animation

✅ Enemies — Towners

Folder: images/enemy/

Contains 3 frames (same logic as hero)

✅ Altar

Folder: images/altar/

Images: altar_0.png → altar_4.png

0–4 represents number of torches lit

✅ Torches

Folder: images/torch/

Lit/unlit images

✅ Map

File: images/map.jpg

Must be used as static background

🔥 GAME LORE SUMMARY

“Darkness is only the light that burned too long…”

Across ages, Towners guarded the Celestial Candelarium, unaware the original flame was made of living shadow.
The player — the Bearer of Ash — must reignite the Torches of Ruin, weakening the false light and restoring the shadow flame.

If all torches are lit → victory
If all torches go out → defeat

Playable locale:
✅ Tinwood Grove

🎮 CORE GAMEPLAY

Player searches and ignites torches

Enemies try to extinguish them

Altar shows how many torches are lit

Enemy strength depends on difficulty

Win if all remain lit

Lose if all go out

✅ WHAT YOU MUST GENERATE

You must output:

✅ 1) Project folder structure (local / VS Code)

Example:

/project
  /scripts
    playerController.js
    enemyAI.js
    torch.js
    altar.js
    gameManager.js
    uiManager.js
  /images
    /hero
    /enemy
    /altar
    /torch
    map.jpg

✅ 2) Scene hierarchy

(Menu + Game)

✅ 3) Full PlayCanvas JS scripts

All code must:

✅ Use pc.createScript
✅ Define attributes
✅ Be attachable to PlayCanvas entities

Provide full source for:

playerController.js

enemyAI.js

torch.js

altar.js

gameManager.js

uiManager.js

Optional: difficulty module

✅ 4) Component + Editor Setup

Explain:

Which components to add (collision, rigidbody, sprite, button)

Which attributes must be assigned

How to bind scripts to entities

✅ 5) Gameplay Flow

Menu → Difficulty → Start → Gameplay → Win/Lose → Return

✅ 6) Additional suggestions

Optional extras such as:

Sound

Music

Particles

Saving progress

✅ RESPONSE FORMAT

Your reply must include:

📁 Folder Structure

🏗 Scene Hierarchy

🧩 Complete Scripts (PlayCanvas JavaScript)

⚙️ Component Setup in Editor

🔄 Game Flow Explanation

✅ Suggestions

If something is missing, make reasonable assumptions.

Produce the full PlayCanvas game implementation based on these requirements — all code must be valid PlayCanvas JavaScript suitable for editing in VS Code.
